## UI Design.

Screenshots of app's views with brief statements of their use

* SPLASHSCREEN

<p align="left">
<img src="./images/splashScreen.png" width="200">
</p>

>> Splash screen displays for four seconds while displaying the laoding icon so the user is aware that the application. Once splashscreen is complete the login activity is then displayed

* LOGIN

<p align="left">

</p>

>> User has the option to login with firebase authentication. If the user currently does not have an account they may select the `Not registered, register here` text which will display the register activity. Email must include `@` and `.` eg `.com, .ie. .co.uk` and password must be 8 characters. If user tries to login without an account a toast message will be displayed stating account does not exist. For existing accounts, the loading icon will display with authentication is taking place

<img src="./images/add2.png" width="200">
</p>

>> This activity allows the user to add or edit a ringfort. They may enter the followinf details, ringfort name, description, image (uploaded from gallery), location, if they have visited the ringfort or not, date in which they visited, rating and if it is a favourite of theres by selecting the heart icon. Un selected favourite is displayed as an outline of a heart and selected favourite is displayed as a red heart as seen in the image above

---

* DSIPLAY FAVOURITES

<p align="left">
<img src="./images/fav.png" width="200">
</p>

>> A user has the option to only display their favourite ringforts by toogling the heart icon under the search bar. When toogled off this heart is displayed as a white outline heart and displayed as a full red heart when selected. This works by updating the list adapter where only favourites are displayed and is unselected all ringforts are displayed

---

* SEARCH RINGFORTS

<p align="left">
<img src="./images/search.png" width="200">
</p>

>> User may also search both the list of all ringforts and the list of favourite ringforts. The search creteria is based on the ringfort name. As the user begins to enter characters the list us updated accordingly

---

* DISPLAY RINGFORTS ON MAP

<p align="left">
<img src="./images/map.png" width="200">
</p>

>> Once ringforts have been created, and their location has been set they will display on a map. If a location tag is selected it will display the ringfort name, description and image

---

* SHARE RINGFORT

<p float="left">
<img src="./images/share.png" width="200">
<img src="./images/text.png" width="200">
</p>

>> On the add/edit ringfort activity, a user may select the `share` button, this will allow the user to send ringfort data via other applications on their device. In the example above the data is being shared via sms. The ringfort name, description, location, rating are sent.

---

* USER SETTINGS

<p align="left">
<img src="./images/settings.png" width="200">
</p>

>> A user may update their user details within the settings activity. It also displays the total of ringforts which are available.

---

* LANDSCAPE MODE

<p align="left">
<img src="./images/landscape.png" width="200">
</p>

>> Instead of creating a layout for landscape mode, after reviewing the android docs I instead added the following line to each activity in the manifest file `android:configChanges="orientation|screenSize|screenLayout|keyboardHidden"` which allows for orientation changes. In the list activity a message is toasted when the user chnages orientation stating if they are in portrait of landscape mode.
